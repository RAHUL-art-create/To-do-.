### Main Features:

1. **Dynamic Skyscape Transitions:**
   - **Time-Based Sky Changes:** The background dynamically transitions between different skies—sunrise, day, sunset, and night—based on user input or system time.
   - **Celestial Animations:** The sun and moon smoothly transition across the sky depending on the time of day, offering a realistic skyscape experience.
   - **Customizable Clouds:** Procedurally generated clouds drift across the sky, adding an atmospheric layer of realism.
   - **Celestial Bodies & Effects:** Features include stars that twinkle during the night and an animated rainbow that appears during rain.

2. **Weather Control:**
   - **Rain Toggle:** Users can start and stop rain animations with a single button. Raindrops are procedurally generated and flow naturally across the screen.
   - **Rainbow Effects:** When rain is enabled during daylight hours, a rainbow appears, creating a visually stunning effect.

3. **Interactive Environment:**
   - **Responsive Celestial Bodies:** Both the sun and moon adapt their size and movement depending on the screen size and user inputs.
   - **Custom Clouds and Stars:** Clouds are generated in various sizes and move fluidly across the screen. Stars only appear at night, twinkling randomly for a more realistic experience.

4. **To-Do List with Sharing Capabilities:**
   - **Task Manager:** Users can create and manage to-do lists with intuitive controls. Tasks can be marked as completed, deleted, and even shared with others.
   - **Sharing Tasks:** With the sharing feature, selected tasks can be encoded and sent via a link that others can access and import into their to-do list.
   - **Collaborative Task Management:** Other users can contribute tasks and share them with the owner of the to-do list, allowing for collaboration.

5. **Interactive Name Feature:**
   - **Name Customization:** Users can customize the main display name by long-pressing on the name to edit it directly.
   - **Animated Name Effects:** When long-pressing, an animated "name effect" triggers, adding extra flair to the web experience.

6. **Time-Sensitive Scene Adjustments:**
   - **Real-Time Updates:** The skyscape updates based on Indian time, shifting the visual elements according to the time of day in India. This allows for an automatic sync of visual elements with real-world conditions.
   - **Custom Scene Adjustments:** Users can also manually adjust the time of day using the slider, altering the skyscape and the positions of the sun, moon, and other elements.

7. **Mobile-Friendly:**
   - **Responsive Design:** The entire experience is optimized for both mobile and desktop, ensuring that all animations, transitions, and interactions work seamlessly on any device.
